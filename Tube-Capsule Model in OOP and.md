Tube-Capsule Model in OOP and 
MATLAB 
Reminder:  
The purpose of these tasks is to show working methods, chain of thought, and most important - 
the ability to explain the work done. Feel free to use any open source data to answer the 
questions. As long as the answer is not completely wrong, the purpose is not the answer itself, 
but the reasoning behind it. Explain we, hy you chose your solution out of different possible 
options. 

Task 1:  
Given:  
1. A 1 kg tubular capsule with 83 mm diameter is accelerated by 6 discrete acceleration 
stages. 
2. The total length of the acceleration tube is 0.5 m. 
3. The tube’s outer diameter is 90 mm. 
Solve: 
1. Design and implement a self-contained simulation service that models the 1-dimensional 
capsule acceleration system. 
2. Make any further assumptions needed, if data is missing. 
3. Allow the user to change parameters. 
4. Plot the interesting outputs from the model, such as velocity and force vs time and vs 
length. 
5. The service should be well-documented, testable, containerized, and provide a clean 
public API (e.g. CLI or HTTP) for simulation runs. 
6. Use Python or Rust. 
7. Clean, modular codebase with OOP or appropriate architecture. 
8. Include Dockerfile, makefile or similar script, sample run configuration. 
   
Task 2:  
Solve: 
1. Download a trial version of MATLAB. 
2. Compile the code from the first task so it can be run from MATLAB. 
3. Use MATLAB to create the user interface, including user-input parameters, and recreate 
the plots in the MATLAB environment. 
Submit both tasks via GitHub with the relevant Readme, links to sample output… 
A short document is expected, including assumptions, work methods, and any relevant 
information about the work done.
