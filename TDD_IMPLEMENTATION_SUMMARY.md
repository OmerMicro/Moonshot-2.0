## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### SOLID Principles Applied
✅ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Coil: Only electromagnetic properties
- Capsule: Motion + electromagnetic behavior  
- AccelerationStage: Timing + electromagnetic coil
- PhysicsEngine: Pure physics calculations

✅ **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Base Coil class: Closed for modification, open for extension
- Capsule and AccelerationStage: Extend without modifying base

✅ **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All coil subclasses can substitute base Coil
- Demonstrated in tests with polymorphic behavior

✅ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- PhysicsEngine: Focused on electromagnetic calculations only
- Clear separation of concerns between components

✅ **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level simulation depends on PhysicsEngine abstraction
- Components depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations

### Domain-Driven Design Elements
✅ **Ubiquitous Language**: Capsule, AccelerationStage, ElectromagneticForce
✅ **Value Objects**: CoilProperties (immutable, validated)
